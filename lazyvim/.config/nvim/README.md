I added `black` python formatter to the `null-ls` config. Following the instructions on the lazyvim website, the `opts` field will try to merge config with the lazyvim config. But since `opts` is defined as a function, I needed to copy the whole function to my own config, and add `black` there. I tested that `flake8` was not working unless I copied the entire function.

Note that there is extra `null-ls` config defined in the lazyvim repo, my extra config merges with that config.

Update on above: I use `table.insert` to clean up the null-ls code

Tried to make shortcut using control-alt-... but couldn't get it to work. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if it's a limitation of vim / iterm

neither of these work:
`map("n", "<C-M-j>", "<cmd>m .+1<cr>==", { desc = "Move down" })`
`map("n", "<C-A-j>", "<cmd>m .+1<cr>==", { desc = "Move down" })`

not totally sure how `nvim-dap-python` is finding the `debugpy` installed via mason, but it seems to be working...
